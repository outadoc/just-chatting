# Kale
Kotlin/JVM IRC message parsing, serialising and notifying. Provides useful abstractions with the intention of splitting message parsing and IRC state management. Useful for building bots, clients and servers.

[Warren](https://github.com/WillowChat/Warren) is the state tracking counterpart.

[Burrow](https://github.com/WillowChat/Burrow) is a new IRC v3.2 server daemon, which uses the parsing and serialising bits of Kale.

[Thump](https://github.com/WillowChat/Thump) is a bridge that lets people chat between Minecraft and IRC whilst they play.

There are basic examples of usage in [KaleRunner.kt](src/main/kotlin/chat/willow/kale/KaleRunner.kt)

## Goals

* Own the parsing & serialising bit of IRC clients and servers
* Let users feed raw lines in, and be notified with strongly typed output messages, covering RFC1459 and IRCv3
* Verify the above with an extensive suite of unit tests
