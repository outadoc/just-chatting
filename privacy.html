        <h1>Just Chatting Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Which data does the app collect?</h2>
        <h3>Twitch username</h3>
        <p>
          In order to log you into Twitch, Just Chatting needs to collect and
          transmit your username to Twitch. However, this is done
          <i>via</i> Twitch's OAuth system, and the app never has access to your
          Twitch password. The app stores this information on the device, in the
          app's storage space.
        </p>
        <h3>Twitch user token</h3>
        <p>
          In order to communicate with Twitch and act on your behalf to send and
          receive messages or other core app functionnality, Just Chatting needs
          to collect a token that has access to some functionnality of your
          Twitch account. The scopes that this token has access to is presented
          to you before you explicitely grant your approval. This token is then
          stored on the device, in the app's storage space.
        </p>
        <h3>Chat messages</h3>
        <p>
          To provide the app's core functionnality, Just Chatting needs to
          collect and transmit your chat messages to Twitch over a secure
          connection. These messages are not persisted on the device, and not
          sent to any other third party.
        </p>
        <h2>Communication with third-parties</h2>
        <h3>Twitch</h3>
        <p>
          Just Chatting regularly communicates with Twitch in order to provide
          its core features. Your data is sent directly from the device to
          Twitch without any intermediate servers. Communication with Twitch is
          mandatory to use the app.
        </p>
        <h3>recent-messages.robotty.de</h3>
        <p>
          Just Chatting uses recent-messages.robotty.de to retrieve recent
          messages from Twitch chats. This service is optional and can be
          disabled in the app settings. This service provides its own privacy
          policy, which you can find at
          <a href="https://recent-messages.robotty.de/privacy">
            recent-messages.robotty.de/privacy</a
          >.
        </p>
        <h3>pronouns.alejo.io</h3>
        <p>
          Just Chatting uses pronouns.alejo.io to fetch and display other users'
          preferred pronouns. This service is optional and can be disabled in
          the app settings.
        </p>
        <h3>BetterTTV</h3>
        <p>
          Just Chatting uses BetterTTV to retrieve extra third-party emotes that
          can be displayed and used in chat. This service is optional and can be
          disabled in the app settings.
        </p>
        <h3>7tv</h3>
        <p>
          Just Chatting uses 7tv to retrieve extra third-party emotes that can
          be displayed and used in chat. This service is optional and can be
          disabled in the app settings.
        </p>
        <h2>How will I be informed of privacy policy changes?</h2>
        <p>
          If the app needs to access more data in the future, this privacy
          policy will be updated, and you will be prompted in-app for your
          permission.
