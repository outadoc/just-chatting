            <h2>Which data does the app collect?</h2>
            <h3>Twitch username</h3>
            <p>
                In order to log you into Twitch, Just Chatting needs to collect and transmit your username to Twitch.
                However, this is done <i>via</i> Twitch's OAuth system, and the app never has access to your Twitch
                password. The app stores this information on the device, in the app's storage space.
            </p>
            <h3>Twitch user token</h3>
            <p>
                In order to communicate with Twitch and act on your behalf to send and receive messages or other core
                app functionnality, Just Chatting needs to collect a token that has access to some functionnality of
                your Twitch account. The scopes that this token has access to is presented to you before you explicitely
                grant your approval. This token is then stored on the device, in the app's storage space.
            </p>
            <h3>Chat messages</h3>
            <p>
                To provide the app's core functionnality, Just Chatting needs to collect and transmit your chat messages
                to Twitch over a secure connection. These messages are not stored on device memory, and not processed by
                any other third party.
            </p>
            <h2>How will I be informed of privacy policy changes?</h2>
            <p>
                If the app needs to access more data in the future, this privacy policy will be updated, and you will be
                prompted in-app for your permission.
