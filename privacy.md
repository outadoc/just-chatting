## What data does the app collect?

### Twitch username

In order to log you into Twitch, Just Chatting needs to collect and transmit your username to Twitch. However, this is done _via_ Twitch's OAuth system, and the app never has access to your Twitch password. The app stores this information on the device, in the app's storage space.

### Twitch user token

In order to communicate with Twitch and act on your behalf to send and receive messages or other core app functionnality, Just Chatting needs to collect a token that has access to some functionnality of your Twitch account. The scopes that this token has access to is presented to you before you explicitely grant your approval. This token is then stored on the device, in the app's storage space.

### Chat messages

To provide the app's core functionnality, Just Chatting needs to collect and transmit your chat messages to Twitch over a secure connection. These messages are not persisted on the device, and not sent to any other third party.

## Communication with third-parties

### Twitch

Just Chatting regularly communicates with Twitch in order to provide its core features. Your data is sent directly from the device to Twitch without any intermediate servers. Communication with Twitch is mandatory to use the app.

### recent-messages.robotty.de

Just Chatting uses recent-messages.robotty.de to retrieve recent messages from Twitch chats. This service is optional and can be disabled in the app settings. This service provides its own privacy policy, which you can find at [recent-messages.robotty.de/privacy](https://recent-messages.robotty.de/privacy).

### pronouns.alejo.io

Just Chatting uses pronouns.alejo.io to fetch and display other users' preferred pronouns. This service is optional and can be disabled in the app settings.

### BetterTTV

Just Chatting uses BetterTTV to retrieve extra third-party emotes that can be displayed and used in chat. This service is optional and can be disabled in the app settings.

### 7tv

Just Chatting uses 7tv to retrieve extra third-party emotes that can be displayed and used in chat. This service is optional and can be disabled in the app settings.

## How will I be informed of privacy policy changes?

If the app needs to access more data in the future, this privacy policy will be updated, and you will be prompted in-app for your permission.
